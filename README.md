# Golang Database Service Boilerplate

This project implements the example as outlined by [this tutorial](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-and-testing-a-rest-api-in-go-with-gorilla-mux-and-postgresql) with a couple of important differences:
- it is dockerized so you dont have to deal with GOPATH
- it uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for dependency management
- it uses a single postgres instance with two databases; dev for actual operation, and test to be used in the test suite
- it adds an opinionated `.editorconfig` (it seems tabs are the "go", but I hate tabs...)

## Overview

The repo is broken into two main parts, `app` and `db`. 

### `app`

`app` contains all the code to run the service. It is further broken down into modules, each strongly tied to a database table.

### `db`

`db` contains the project structure generated by [`Flask-Migrate`](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-Migrate) which itself is a helpful wrapper around [`Alembic`](https://github.com/zzzeek/alembic).
